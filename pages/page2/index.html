                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>The company has since passed 
                        from generation to generation and is to this day still owned by the Kirk 
                       It has come a long way over the past 90 years - from a small carpenter’s
                       workshop to a modern, global enterprise that is now one of the world’s largest 
                       manufacturers of toys. The LEGO brick is our most important product. We are proud 
                       to have been named “Toy of the Century” twice. Our products have undergone extensive 
                       development over the years – but the foundation remains the traditional LEGO brick.
                    The brick in its present form was launched in 1958. The interlocking principle withh
                     its tubes makes it unique and offers unlimited building possibilities. It's just a 
                     matter of getting the imagination going – and letting a wealth of creative ideas
                      emerge through play.

                        In 2014 Warner Bros and The Lego Group released The Lego Movie,
                         a computer-animated adventure comedy film telling the story of an ordinary 
                         Lego Mini-figure construction worker named Emmet Brickowski prophesied to save the world. 
                         It received one of the highest recorded openings for an original animated movie,
                          and the Los Angeles Times noted "nearly unanimous positive reviews" for the film.
                        In November 2020 Lego announced its largest set to date: a replica of the 
                        Colosseum in Rome containing 9,036 pieces. The set overtakes the previous
                        record holder, the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars franchise.In 2021 
                        this record was topped by the Titanic model at 9,090 pieces. In 2022 the 
                        second set to reach 10,000 bricks was released, a replica of the Eiffel 
                        Tower with 10,001 pieces. The first was the Lego World map.
